## **📝 Title**

**Spike: Create Webpack Module Federation Host App for MFE Orchestration**

---

## **📖 Description**

### **Background**

We are currently developing a custom JavaScript MFE loader (`mfe-loader.js`) as part of our ongoing MFE architecture spike to dynamically load and mount React micro-frontends in our Smarty application. As we continue exploring MFE approaches, we need to investigate whether a webpack-built Module Federation host app could provide additional benefits for our enterprise needs.

### **Problem Statement**

For enterprise-scale MFE architecture, we need capabilities that include:

- ✓ Cross-MFE component sharing capabilities
- ✓ Webpack's built-in Module Federation optimizations
- ✓ Standardized MFE orchestration patterns
- ✓ Advanced error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
- ✓ Performance monitoring and bundle optimization
- ✓ Type safety for remote module imports

### **Proposed Solution**

Investigate creating a webpack-built JavaScript host application that leverages Module Federation to understand its potential benefits compared to our current custom loader approach.

### **Research Questions**

1. How does webpack Module Federation compare to our custom loader approach?
2. Can we achieve cross-MFE component sharing with Module Federation?
3. What are the performance implications of the webpack approach?
4. How complex would integration with Smarty be?

---

## **🎯 Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] **AC1**: Create webpack Module Federation host that loads our existing React Task Manager MFE
- [ ] **AC2**: Demonstrate cross-MFE component sharing between two MFEs using Module Federation
- [ ] **AC3**: Document comparison analysis and provide recommendation (custom loader vs webpack approach)

---

## **🔍 Technical Investigation Areas**

### **1. Module Federation Configuration**

```javascript
// Research optimal configuration for enterprise scale
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'smarty_mfe_host',
  remotes: {
    // Dynamic remote configuration
    // Runtime remote discovery
    // Fallback strategies
  },
  shared: {
    // Shared dependency optimization
    // Version management
    // Singleton enforcement
  },
});
```

### **2. Auto-Discovery Mechanism**

- How to replicate current DOM-based auto-discovery
- Dynamic remote registration
- Runtime MFE configuration updates

### **3. Integration Patterns**

- Smarty template integration strategies
- Data passing mechanisms
- URL routing considerations
- SEO implications

### **4. Performance Optimization**

- Code splitting strategies
- Lazy loading implementation
- Bundle size optimization
- Caching mechanisms

### **5. Cross-MFE Communication**

- Component sharing patterns
- Event-based communication
- Shared state management
- Type safety across boundaries

---

## **📊 Success Metrics**

### **Technical Metrics**

- **Performance**: Competitive load times (baseline: ~1s MFE load)
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized shared dependencies
- **Error Rate**: < 1% MFE loading failures
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage for remote imports

### **Business Metrics**

- **Developer Experience**: Improved debugging and development workflow
- **Scalability**: Support for 10+ concurrent MFEs
- **Maintainability**: Reduced custom code, leveraging webpack standards
